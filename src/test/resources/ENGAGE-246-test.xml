Like a tune that lingers in the mind, its history speaks to the hearts of all: Montrealers, people experiencing its charm for the first time, and those who just keep coming back. The McCord Museum's permanentexhibition, entitled 
<em>
<strong>

An array of First Nations objects, full of symbolism and emotion; a selection of extraordinary photographs by the renowned Canadian photographer William Notman; a variety of sports equipment and charming toys; a series of splendid gowns and outfits worn by illustrious Montrealers - over 
<strong>
800 objects
</strong>
from the McCord's famous collection will bring the great Montreal adventure to life.
<br/>
<br/>
Accented with interactive installations and enveloped in evocative atmospheres,

<strong>
Simply Montréal
</strong>
